# Invite to Party

Self-hosted invite-only RSVP tool: a host creates parties (name, vanity URL
slug, background images, event date) and guest invites; each guest gets an
invite code as their only credential, opens it at `/` or a party's vanity
path, and can accept or decline (with an optional companion) until the
party's date passes — no guest accounts, no self-registration.

**Try out the demo:** a live demo instance is not deployed yet — run
`MODE=demo docker compose up --build` locally to explore the seeded demo
host/party/invites. Host-side mutations (party/invite/image CRUD) are
disabled in demo mode; the guest RSVP flow stays fully interactive.

## Architecture

Monorepo with npm workspaces (`frontend`, `backend`, `e2e`):

- **`backend/`** – Node.js + Express API under `/api`, PostgreSQL via `pg`
  and `node-pg-migrate` for versioned migrations. Host-only JWT login, with
  the token set as an httpOnly cookie (no `localStorage`); guests
  authenticate purely via their invite code. Details, API list and CLI
  commands: [`backend/README.md`](backend/README.md).
- **`frontend/`** – Vue 3 + Vite + Tailwind CSS, Pinia for the host auth
  store, Vue Router. Component overview: [`frontend/README.md`](frontend/README.md).
- **`e2e/`** – Playwright end-to-end tests against the full stack spun up
  via Docker Compose.

In production, nginx (in the frontend container) serves the built frontend
files and proxies requests to `/api` to the backend container (see
`frontend/nginx.conf`, `frontend/Dockerfile`).

## Local development (without a Docker rebuild cycle)

Prerequisite: Node.js 22, a running Postgres (easiest via Docker Compose,
see below).

```bash
npm install                # once, installs all workspaces
cp .env.example .env       # adjust Postgres credentials/JWT_SECRET
docker compose up db       # start only Postgres
```

Then develop with hot reload in two terminals:

```bash
npm run dev --workspace=backend    # nodemon, Express API on port 3000
npm run dev --workspace=frontend   # Vite dev server, proxies /api to port 3000
```

Run the backend migrations before the first start (details in
[`backend/README.md`](backend/README.md)):

```bash
npm run migrate --workspace=backend
```

The frontend is then reachable at the address Vite prints (default:
`http://localhost:5173`), the backend at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Docker Compose setup

For a production-like full stack (Postgres + backend + nginx/frontend) at
the repo root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # if not already done
docker compose up --build
```

This starts three services:

- `db` – `postgres:16-alpine` with a persistent `postgres-data` volume.
- `backend` – the Express API (migrations run on startup, see
  `backend/Dockerfile`), uploaded party images stored in a separate
  `uploads-data` volume.
- `frontend` – multi-stage build (Vite build → `nginx:alpine`), serves the
  static files and proxies `/api` to `backend`.

The app is then reachable at `http://localhost` (port configurable via
`FRONTEND_PORT` in `.env`). For host management (creating a host account,
seeding demo data) in the running container see
[`backend/README.md`](backend/README.md).

## Tests

- Backend: `npm test --workspace=backend` (Vitest + Supertest against an
  **isolated** test Postgres instance, migrations run automatically
  beforehand via `pretest`). Before the first run, start
  `docker compose --profile test up -d db-test` once – details and
  background (protection against accidentally wiping the dev DB) in
  [`backend/README.md`](backend/README.md).
- Frontend: `npm test --workspace=frontend` (Vitest + Testing Library).
- E2E: `npm run test:e2e` (Playwright, expects a running stack, e.g. via
  `docker compose up --build -d`).
- Lint (all workspaces incl. `e2e`): `npm run lint`.

The GitHub Action under `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs all four jobs on
every push/PR against `main`, plus a `publish` job on `main`.
